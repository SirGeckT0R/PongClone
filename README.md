# PongClone

Developed with Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints

PongClone is a game where you try to deflect the ball from your side of the wall. You can play with either a computer or other player. The goal of the game is to prevent the ball from touching your wall and to do the opposite with your opponent's side. If the ball touches any part of player's wall, it respawns at a random location and the game continues.
